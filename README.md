# Dotask - Todo List Application

Dotask is a simple yet efficient Todo List Application built using React. It allows users to manage their tasks easily, with features such as adding, editing, and deleting todos, as well as marking them as completed.

## Features

- **Add Todos:** Quickly add new tasks to your list.
- **Edit Todos:** Modify your tasks as needed.
- **Delete Todos:** Remove tasks that are no longer relevant.
- **Mark as Completed:** Check off tasks once they are done.
- **Persistent Storage:** All tasks are saved in `localStorage`, so your list remains intact even after refreshing the page.
